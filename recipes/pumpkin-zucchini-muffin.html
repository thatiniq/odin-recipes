    <h3>Description</h3>
    
       <p>Muffins are fast and easy to make. They're a favorite in any household, especially where there
          are kids around the house. The basis for this recipe came from the 'Eat Clean Diet'.
          The zucchini is a great way to add veggies and fiber. Make a batch or 2 and freeze them for 
          mornings when you're in a hurry or just need a snack! You can warm one up in the microwave 
          and drizzle a little agave nectar over it!
