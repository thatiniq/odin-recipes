    <h3>Description</h3>
    
       <p>Muffins are fast and easy to make. They're a favorite in any household, especially where there
          are kids around the house. The basis for this recipe came from the 'Eat Clean Diet'.
          The zucchini is a great way to add veggies and fiber. Make a batch or 2 and freeze them for 
          mornings when you're in a hurry or just need a snack! You can warm one up in the microwave 
          and drizzle a little agave nectar over it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         
       <ul>                            
          <li>2 cups of oats</li>                       <li>1 cup canned pumpkin</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups whole wheat flour</li>           <li>1 cup almond milk</li>
          <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>              <li>½ cup agave nectar</li>
          <li>1 cup raisins</li>                        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>          <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>        <li>2 cups grated zucchini</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
          
       </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
       
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line 
                them with paper liners.</li>

            <li>Combine oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, raisins, baking powder, 
                pumpkin pie spice, and baking soda in a bowl.</li>

            <li>Mix zucchini, pumpkin, almond milk, agave nectar, eggs, and canola oil in a 
                separate bowl; stir into dry ingredients until just combined. Spoon batter 
                into the prepared muffin cups.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a 
                muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
